### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Leslie
I have graduated from National University of Singapore in the very start of 2022. I have worked/ interned in companies including Human Resources, Engineering, Audit etc with a combined experience of 1-2 years. I started my career as a web developer, and is still pursuing and attending courses to improve my coding skills in web frameworks and technologies. Iâ€™m currently working with Javascript/ Typescript projects. During my free time, I read technology books as a way of self exploration.
